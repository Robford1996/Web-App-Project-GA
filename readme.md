# Future Plans
* Would like to find API's with more data to retrieve from and possibly build upon the web app
* use media query to make the web page mobile friendly as well 
* Would like to perhaps use a bootstrap to make the CSS of the web app look a lot better

# About The Author
I love to build user friendly web applications where I can challenge myself to make improvements to make them better and better. I love coding and solving problems so that I can find ways to make the applications run more efficiently. Creating something from a blank web browser and seeing it come to life brings me so much happiness!
